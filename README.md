# whoistory
This code / PoC is part of an MSc project.
It aims to visualise relations between historical WHOIS objects and attributes.


Prerequisites:
--------------
- Python (tested with version 2.7.10 on Mac OS X 10.13.6)
- Maltego Classic (tested with 4.1.12.11480, Java 1.8.0_131)

Limitations
-----------
- Only works with RIPE  WHOIS Database for now.
- It's about Internet Number Resources (IP addresses, AS numbers), not domains
- PoC code might not work properly for all use cases.

Road map
--------
- Clean up, improve current code
- Add code to query APNIC and AFRINIC historical WHOIS records

Let me know if you've found bugs, have feauture requests, or what to participate in this small project.

Disclaimer: I'm not a coder, so be gentle.
