# whoistory
This code / PoC is part of an MSc project.
It aims to visualise relations between historical WHOIS objects and its attributes, using Maltego local transforms and custom entities.

Prerequisites:
--------------
- Python (tested with version 2.7.10 on Mac OS X 10.13.6)
- Maltego Classic (tested with version 4.1.12.11480, and Java 1.8.0_131)

Limitations
-----------
- Only works with the RIPE WHOIS Database for now.
- It's about Internet Number Resources (IP addresses, AS numbers), not domains
- PoC code might not work properly for all use cases.

Road map
--------
- Clean up, improve current code
- Add code to query APNIC and AFRINIC historical WHOIS records

Disclaimer
----------
I'm not a coder, so the code might need some improvements. Be gentle. :-)

Let me know if you've found bugs, have feauture requests, or want to participate in this small project.
